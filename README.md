TODO:
* get filters to work together --> done but had to remove transitions but maybe another way to do this?
* smoother reset filter transition? e.g. timeout?
* filter sliders - style better?
* Show x and y value details on hover, or project line on axis, or highlight x and y axis values in details view
* Make college name more visible on details view
* Highlight selected college on click
* Add Comparision of colleges and show both details and maybe graphs
* Zoom reset button?
* Maybe use transitions in between graphs instead of tabs?
* maybe change placement of axis labels - kind of hard to see when overlapped.
