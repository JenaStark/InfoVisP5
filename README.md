TODO:
* Style graph correctly and remove data included in pie chart from text
* color selections, circles better

Maybes:
* fix inconsistencies on sliders between charts? - the values on the sliders change probably because of how we exclude points that are zero.
* filter sliders - style better?
* smoother reset filter transition? e.g. timeout?
* Zoom reset button?
* Maybe use transitions in between graphs instead of tabs?
