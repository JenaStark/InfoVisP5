# InfoVisP5				
TODO:
* Show x and y value details on hover, or project line on axis, or highlight x and y axis values in details view
* Add Comparision of colleges and show both details and maybe graphs
* change placement or style of axis labels - kind of hard to see when overlapped.
* color selections, circles better

Maybes:
* fix inconsistencies on sliders between charts? - the values on the sliders change probably because of how we exclude points that are zero.
* filter sliders - style better?
* smoother reset filter transition? e.g. timeout?
* Zoom reset button?
* Maybe use transitions in between graphs instead of tabs?
